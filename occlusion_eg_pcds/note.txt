the last 2 pcds are a heavily occluded sofa and table
they overlap perfectly, but because their bounding box is small compared to the actual pcd, the IoU is minimal

thus, we could either include a last comparison step in process image to combine all of these cases,
      or add a very strict overlap only condition when aggregating
